## Autism Spectrum Disorder

The number of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been going up over the past decade. It is not clear yet why we see an increase in ASD. One of the challenges is the complexity of ASD identification in children that requires a trained health professional. A better understanding of health factors associated with ASD would be beneficial for simplifying the diagnosis process as well as for learning more about ASD phenomenon and developing new therapies for children.

The goal of this project was to identify health attributes or behavior patterns that are associated with ASD diagnoses. 

Data used in this project came from a telephone survey conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - National Survey of Childrenâ€™s Health data from 2011-2012.
